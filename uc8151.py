    # This function (after all this big comment) sets the lookup tables
    # used during the display refresh. Before reading it, it's a good
    # idea to understand how LUTs are encoded:
    #
    # We have a table for each transition possibile:
    # white -> white (WW)
    # white -> black (WB)
    # black -> black (BB)
    # black -> white (BW)
    # and a final table that controls the VCOM common voltage.
    #
    # The update process happens in steps, each 7 rows of each
    # table tells the display how to set each pixel based on the
    # transition (WW, WB, BB, BW) and VCOM in each step. Usually just
    # three or two steps are used.
    #
    # When we talk about a "WW" transition or "WB" transition, what we
    # mean is the difference between the pixel value set in the *last*
    # display update, and the pixel value of the *current* display update.
    # So if in the previous update a pixel was white, and later the pixel
    # turns black, then it's a WB transition and will be handled by the
    # WB LUT.
    #
    # VCOM table is different and explained later, but for the first four
    # tables, this is how to interpret them. For instance the
    # lookup for WW in the second row (step 1) could be set to:
    #
    # 0x60, 0x02, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01 -> last byte = repeat count
    #  \     |      |    |     |
    #   \    +------+----+-----+-> number of frames
    #    \_ four transitions
    #
    # The first byte must be read as four two bits integers:
    #
    # 0x60 is: 01|10|00|00
    #
    # Where each 2 bit number menas:
    # 00 - Put to ground
    # 01 - Put to VDH voltage (10v in our config): pixel becomes black
    # 10 - Put to VDL voltage (-10v in our config): pixel becomes white
    # 11 - Floating / Not used.
    #
    # Then the next four bytes in the row mean how many
    # "frames" we hold a given state (the frame duration depends on the
    # frequency set in the PLL, here we configure it to 100 HZ so 10ms).
    # 
    # So in the above case: hold pixel at VDH for 2 frames, then
    # hold at VDL for 2 frame. The last two entries say 0 frames,
    # so they are not used. The final byte in the row, 0x01, means
    # that this sequence must be repeated just once. If it was 2
    # the whole sequence would repeat 2 times and so forth.
    #
    # The VCOM table is similar, but the bits meaning is different:
    # 00 - Put VCOM to VCOM_DC voltage
    # 01 - Put VCOM to VDH+VCOM_DC voltage (see PWR register config)
    # 10 - Put VCOM to VDL+VCOM_DC voltage
    # 11 - Floating / Not used.
    #
    # The VCOM table has two additional bytes at the end.
    # The meaning of these bytes apparently is the following (but I'm not
    # really sure what they mean):
    # 
    # First additional byte: ST_XON, if (1<<step) bit is set, for
    # that step all gates are on. Second byte: ST_CHV. Like ST_XON
    # but if (1<<step) bit is set, VCOM voltage is set to high for this step.
    #

    # not used and we don't use it either.
